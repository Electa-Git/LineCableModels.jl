# QUARANTINE

This branch is not a "feature." It is a hot-patched, hard-coded abomination summoned from the abyss solely to unblock the simulation pipeline. It is technical debt with a pulse.

Do not merge. Do not “tidy it up.” Do not “just rebase it quickly.”
Cherry-pick only if you really know what you are doing and why.

If you’re here because you made a series of life choices that were as questionable as your coding skills: welcome.
This branch is what regret looks like when one says, *"- Hey, but it runs, eh?"*

**Abandon hope, all ye who `git checkout` here.**
