`LineCableModels.jl` is a Julia package for computing the electrical parameters of arbitrary arrangements of underground and overhead power cables, with built-in uncertainty quantification. It is designed as a general-purpose and scalable toolbox to calculate transmission line parameters and to construct models for steady-state analysis and electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations.
  
## Main features

- **Comprehensive cable modeling:** Detailed representation of conductors (solid, tubular, stranded), insulation layers, screens, armoring, and semicons.
- **Line and cable constants:** Accurate DC and AC parameters (R, L, C, G) with correction factors for temperature, stranding, and helical effects.
- **Propagation characteristics:** Rigorous electromagnetic   models for cable internal impedances and earth-return paths.
- **Multiple solvers:** Analytical formulations, finite element modeling, and interfaces to EMT programs, including PSCAD.
- **Materials and cables library:** Store and reuse standardized material properties and cable designs across projects.

## Documentation
