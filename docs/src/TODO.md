# TODO for LineCableModels.jl

This is a living document intended to track scientific development priorities and research directions for new features, methods and solutions to be included in the package.

For bugs, features and implementation taks, the [Issues](https://github.com/Electa-Git/LineCableModels.jl/issues) page is used.

## Wishlist

- [ ] Pipe-type cables and MoM-SO implementation.

## In progress

- [ ] Implementation of frequency-dependent soil properties.
- [ ] Development of novel formulations for cables composed of N concentrical layers, allowing for accurate representations of semiconductor materials.
- [ ] Implementation of an interface to run finite element simulations using [Onelab](https://onelab.info/).

## Done âœ“

- [x] Object-oriented data model for cables, conductors, insulations and materials.
